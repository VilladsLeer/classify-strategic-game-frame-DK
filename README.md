# Strategic-game-frames in the danish political media
Here is a multilabel classifier based on danish BERT finetuned on a corpus of news articles to detect strategic-game-frames in danish. I trained it for my master thesis in political science, feel free to use it for personal or academic projects.


Strategic-game-frame is defined and conceptualized based on the operationalization presented in: 

Aalberg, Toril, Jesper Strömbäck og Claes H. de Vreese (2011) ”The framing of politics as strategy and game: A review of concepts, operationalizations and key findings” Journalism 13(2) 162–178


The classifier is based on Danish BERT pretrained by BotXO and is finetuned in pytorch lightning.
